# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Business Intelligence Project

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and extracting **business insights** from a structured dataset using Python.  
The aim is to analyze patterns, relationships, and trends in the data and present them in a clear and business-friendly manner.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the dataset using descriptive statistics
- Perform univariate and multivariate analysis
- Answer real-world business questions
- Visualize insights using charts
- Design a static dashboard mock-up for key KPIs

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **File:** `final_cleaned_videodata.csv`
- The dataset contains demographic and income-related attributes such as age, gender, education, working hours, and income category.
- The dataset is already cleaned and ready for analysis.

---

## ❓ Business Questions
The business questions addressed in this project are listed in:

📄 **`business_questions.txt`**

Key questions include:
- What is the distribution of income levels?
- How does income vary by gender?
- Does education level affect income?
- How do working hours differ by income group?
- What factors are associated with higher income?

## 🧠 Analysis & Implementation

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding
📄 **`data_understanding.py`**
- Dataset loading
- Structure and data types
- Descriptive statistics
- Initial exploration

---

### 2️⃣ Business Queries & Insights
📄 **`queries.py`**
- Income distribution analysis
- Average age by income group
- Average working hours per week by income
- Education vs income analysis
- Gender vs income comparison

(Pandas operations are used as SQL-equivalent logic.)

---

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization
📄 **`data_visualization.py`**
- Income distribution plots
- Gender vs income charts

These plots help in understanding relationships between multiple variables.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- The majority of individuals earn `<=50K`.
- Males are more represented in the `>50K` income group.
- Higher education levels show a strong correlation with higher income.
- Individuals earning `>50K` tend to work more hours per week on average.
